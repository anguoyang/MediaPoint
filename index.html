<p>MediaPoint will help you play multimedia without much hassle, which usually is downloading video codecs, and wants to look nice at the same time.
This project started as a hobby, but eventually came close to become a product. This is why this Github project exists. MediaPoint is based on a few principles:</p>

<pre><code>- look cool
- be functional
- be usable
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the MediaPoint intro screen, which is actually animated:

<p>This project is currently pretty much at its begginings, and not much media player functionality is implemented but in the following paragraphs we will discuss some areas of what will be done.</p>

<p>Downloading MediaPoint is the only thing you need to play multimedia. Most consumer file types are supported out of the box. The program comes with integrated LAV filters, and does not install anything around in your windows installation.</p>

<p>Ultra-HD (4092x2160) video playback is supported on decent hardware. Decent means a speedy dual core or quad core CPU and a standalone DirectX9 GPU with 512MB of RAM.</p>

<p>Here is a pre-alpha screenshot of MediaPoint playing a 4K video file (ultra-HD):

<a name="movies-are-recognized-thanks-to-imdb-integration" class="anchor" href="#movies-are-recognized-thanks-to-imdb-integration"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Movies are recognized thanks to IMDb integration</h3>

<p>If a video file you are playing is recognized as a movie, MediaPoint will talk to IMDb, fetch movie metadata and show it to you. You can see most of the interesting stuff, and check the cast at any point during movie playback.</p>

<h3>
<a name="movies-will-have-subtitles-with-no-effort" class="anchor" href="#movies-will-have-subtitles-with-no-effort"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Movies will have subtitles with no effort</h3>

<p>MediaPoint will fetch subtitles for movies recognized by IMDb from popular subtitle download services according to the settings you preferred (languages, services). If a perfect match is found for your movie filename it will come automatically, else you will get to choose which subtitle you wish to fetch.</p>

<a name="audio-playback-is-not-forgotten" class="anchor" href="#audio-playback-is-not-forgotten"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Audio playback is not forgotten</h3>

<p>At some point MediaPoint will have a proper playlist and be able to function as a solid audio player. There will be a skin mode "Minimal" which will be tailored exactly for this kind of usage.</p>

<a name="taskbar-integration-makes-it-easier-to-control-the-player" class="anchor" href="#taskbar-integration-makes-it-easier-to-control-the-player"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Taskbar integration makes it easier to control the player</h3>

<p>Sometimes you want to play a movie full screen on another monitor. In this case it becomes hard to control what the player is doing without interfering into the experience of those that are watching. MediaPoint has controls embedded into the taskbar icon preview, and also in the tray icon. You can do stuff even without interacting with the player itself.</p>

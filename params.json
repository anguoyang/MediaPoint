{"name":"Mediapoint","tagline":"A C# WPF Media Player with integrated LAV filters","body":"### Welcome to MediaPoint\r\n\r\nMediaPoint will help you play multimedia without much hassle, which usually is downloading video codecs, and wants to look nice at the same time.\r\nThis project started as a hobby, but eventually came close to become a product. This is why this Github project exists. MediaPoint is based on a few principles:\r\n\r\n```\r\n- look cool\r\n- be functional\r\n- be usable\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is the MediaPoint intro screen, which is actually animated:\r\n![MediaPoint](http://f.cloud.github.com/assets/160009/2075698/0bf035b4-8d93-11e3-9a44-711855dbe1b6.png)\r\n\r\nThis project is currently pretty much at its begginings, and not much media player functionality is implemented but in the following paragraphs we will discuss some areas of what will be done.\r\n\r\n### Powerful integrated codecs\r\nDownloading MediaPoint is the only thing you need to play multimedia. Most consumer file types are supported out of the box. The program comes with integrated LAV filters, and does not install anything around in your windows installation.\r\n\r\nUltra-HD (4092x2160) video playback is supported on decent hardware. Decent means a speedy dual core or quad core CPU and a standalone DirectX9 GPU with 512MB of RAM.\r\n\r\nHere is a pre-alpha screenshot of MediaPoint playing a 4K video file (ultra-HD):\r\n![MediaPoint](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/160009/2075691/de768c96-8d92-11e3-915d-c7d68a174a39.png)\r\n\r\n### Movies are recognized thanks to IMDb integration\r\nIf a video file you are playing is recognized as a movie, MediaPoint will talk to IMDb, fetch movie metadata and show it to you. You can see most of the interesting stuff, and check the cast at any point during movie playback.\r\n\r\n### Movies will have subtitles with no effort\r\nMediaPoint will fetch subtitles for movies recognized by IMDb from popular subtitle download services according to the settings you preferred (languages, services). If a perfect match is found for your movie filename it will come automatically, else you will get to choose which subtitle you wish to fetch.\r\n\r\nMediaPoint showing IMDb info and subtitles:\r\n![MediaPoint](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/160009/2075695/f2767c38-8d92-11e3-8484-698ef30951e5.png)\r\n\r\n### Audio playback is not forgotten\r\nAt some point MediaPoint will have a proper playlist and be able to function as a solid audio player. There will be a skin mode \"Minimal\" which will be tailored exactly for this kind of usage.\r\n\r\n### Taskbar integration makes it easier to control the player\r\nSometimes you want to play a movie full screen on another monitor. In this case it becomes hard to control what the player is doing without interfering into the experience of those that are watching. MediaPoint has controls embedded into the taskbar icon preview, and also in the tray icon. You can do stuff even without interacting with the player itself.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nMediaPoint was started by Marino Šimić (@msimic) at some point in 2013., and went online to Github in 02/2014. We are currently searching for contributors.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nCheck the Github MediaPoint Wiki, if you still have question contact on marino.simic@gmail.com\r\n","google":"UA-47783141-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
